# Mathematical Methods

# Purpose 

The purpose of this application is for it to act as a teaching tool for Year 12 High School teachers following recent changes to the Australian Curriculum. The design is not to replace any of the teacher's roles, but rather complement the teacher's explanations of topics. For this reason, the application mostly consists of visual demonstrations. 

# The Curriculum 

The following has been taken directly from the Australian Curriculum as of May 16th 2021. 

## Topic 1: The Logarithmic Function

# App Features 

Here we highligh exactly what the goal of each tab in the appliaction was, and how these activities relate to the curriculum. 

## Tab 1 - Welcome 

The welcome tab is designed to give the user an idea of what to expect in the other tabs in the application. 

## Tab 2 - Topic 1 

Topic 1 covers the logarithm function. It contains the formula for the general form of a logarithm, a plot of the logarithm function along with its inverse, and some interactive sliders that the user can use to manipulate the graph. This is designed to familiarise the students with the logarithm function by providing a visual association with the different parameter values. 

Students can stretch, translate, mirror and change the base of the logarithm (between $e, 10$ and $2$).

## Tab 3 - Topic 2

### Welcome 

In the welcome page we give a very brief description of what the activity is about, then a glossary of key terms that will be used throughout this section. 

### Random Variables 

The random variables section provides background information and equations for the key distributions covered in this section of the Cambridge mathematical methods textbook, namely, bernoulli, binomial and normal distributions. 

Students/teachers select the distribution of interest, assign values to the parameters of said distribution and then they can see what the probability density/mass function and cumulative density/mass function look like. They will also see some descriptive text explaining how these can be interpreted, and also the equations for the pdf, expected value and variance. 

### Examples of Other Distributions 

There aren't explicitly any other distributions mentioned in the curriculum or the textbook, but this tab shows the students that there are other distributions outside of the three that they cover. Here we have three other examples of discrete distributions (Geometric, Negative Binomial and Poisson) and three other examples of continuous distributions (Uniform, Exponential and Gamma). 

### Dice Roll Experiment 

The goal of the dice roll experiment is to illustrate the convergence of an experimental expected value to a theoretical expected value. The activity takes a standard dice, gives the user the option to roll once or roll 100 times, and after each roll or set of rolls a cumulative mean is calculated. This mean is then plotted against the number of rolls, and compared to a red line representing the theoretical mean of 3.5. The idea is that as we add more and more rolls, the mean, or expected value, gets closer and closer to the red line.  

## Tab 4 - Topic 3

### Welcome 

Like the other welcome pages, this gives an intro to the activity. The difference here is that it also introduces the virtual reef diver data, giving a brief background on the image annotation process. Just like for the previous topic we have a glossary of key terms to be used throughout the activity. 

### Random Sampling 

In this activity users are expected to use random sampling as a method for approximating the value of $\pi$. This is done by considering $\pi$ as a ratio between the area of a circle and the area of a square. Dropping a number of points onto a square which contains a circle of the same radius allows up to use the number of points inside the square as an estimator of the area (and likewise for the circle). What the user should find is that as we add more and more points to the square and circle, which are chosen randomly, the approximation for the value of $\pi$ gets better and better. This logic can then be extrapolated to conclude that if we have an infinite number of points, we would be able to ascertain the exact value for $\pi$. This activity can be used as a way to highlight the difference between a sample proportion and a population proportion, and the fact that as we approach a sample size close to our population, our estimate becomes better. 

### Sample Proportions 

This activity is fairly limited. The aim is to investigate the long term behaviour of random sampling, and this is the first activity that makes use of the virtual reef diver data. Users will select a classification to investigate out of hard coral, soft coral or algae. Next, they will select the number of images they wish to sample (out of the total 100) using the slider. Once they select a button to sample 10 or 100 times, the program does the following (using "sample 10 times" as an example): 

- selects 10 samples of n images, where n is given by the slider value, at random 
- the proportion of points with the selected classification is computed for each sample 
- a histogram of the proportions for all samples is plotted 

If a button, or combination of buttons, is selected more than once, these new samples are added to the dataset which already exists. This allows the user to inspect the changes in the distribution of proportions as more and more samples are added. 

### Confidence Intervals for Proportions 

In this tab we present an interactive visualisation of the 95% confidence intervals for a proportion. Here we also use the virtual reef diver data. Much like in the previous tab, the user will select a classification and the number of images they would like to sample from the population of 100 images. The user then tells the program to sample once or ten times. Once a button is pressed, the program will pull out the required number of samples, compute the proportion of the chosen classification for each sample and then also compute the 95% confidence interval for that proportion (using the formula given in the Cambridge textbook). 

The proportion and its corresponding confidence intervals are then plotting for each sample. Also shown on the plot is a vertical line indicating the true population proportion for the entire 100 images. The proportions and intervals are then coloured according to whether the interval contains the true population mean. 

Like in the previous tab, the buttons here act as an accumulation of samples, therefore, pressing them multiple times adds more samples to the existing dataset.   

# The Code 

The code for this application is contained within the `app.R` file and though it is heavily commented, there are some general details here on how it is structured. 

The code is broken up into three main sections, which is typical for a shiny application: 

- Helper functions 
- User Interface 
- Server 

Each of the User Interface and Server sections are then further split by topic to keep things in order. Below is a list of the Inputs and Outputs that relate to each of the topics discussed in the sections above. 

## Topic 1 - Logarithms
